# Quadrature-Decoder
The requirements for this assignment specified that using an MSP432 microcontroller, one had to alter an LCD module such that it can display a setting that can be adjusted. The setting would be controlled a rotary encoder such that when turned clockwise, the setting is increased and when turned counterclockwise, the setting would decrease. 

Although this assignment provided  some skeleton code that was written in earlier projects, the most relevant code to this project was written in main.c, LCD.c, and FSM.c.
